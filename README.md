## Java vs Javascript?

95% code are written in Java.
But I'm trying to do more Javascript and python here.

When I was young I deeply believe the older language that needs compilation like Java and C++ are better than script language like javacript , lisp and python.

However, new languages, although far away from OS and has big payload in storing data,
they are more flexable, more productive.
Sure it runs slower, but it saves hours to write your business logic and UI.

The software engineering is all about *Quality* vs *Speed* vs *Human Resource*, runtime speed? It's not crucial in all of your cases!


## Stay Sharp

Keep coding!
